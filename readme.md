## Overview

This project is an exploratory data analysis of a dataset sourced from **Goodreads**, focused on understanding trends in user ratings, book popularity, and author patterns. The project involved data cleaning, transformation, and visual exploration using **Python** and popular data science libraries. The goal was to derive insights into user preferences, identify outliers and patterns, and explore potential avenues for recommendation systems or further modelling.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Goodreads dataset (originally sourced via Kaggle)

## What Was Done

- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and filtering irrelevant rows  
- Exploratory analysis: Relationships & Trends over time 
- Visualisation: A range of static plots and charts were created to explore the dataset in a meaningful, intuitive way

## Current Status

> **Note**: This project is currently on hold.

Due to changes in the availability and structure of the original dataset, as well as shifting time commitments toward other active projects, further development has been temporarily paused. The work completed so far still provides a foundation for anyone looking to explore Goodreads data from an analytical perspective.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) file in your local environment  
3. Ensure required packages are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
4. Run the cells step-by-step to reproduce the analysis and visualisations
