## Overview

An exploratory data analysis of a Goodreads dataset (https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k) focusing on user ratings, title popularity, and author trends. The work covers data cleaning (missing values, type fixes, de-duplication, and filtering), feature preparation, and visual exploration to surface patterns, outliers, and signals that could inform basic recommendation approaches. This was not intended to be a 'solving' project, but to use new visualisations and gain additonal knowledge on python packages and data manipulation soley using python. Notebooks are reproducible end-to-end and document each step of the workflow. Note, development is paused due to ongoing alterations in the public dataset; the existing notebook remains a solid foundation for further modelling or dashboarding.
